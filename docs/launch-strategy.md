# Launch Strategy (Next 30-90 Days)

## Your Competitive Edge is Real. Here's How to Leverage It.

You're about to launch something that **doesn't exist yet**:
- ✅ First robotics-specific adaptive learning platform
- ✅ AI-powered roadmap generation for roboticists
- ✅ Session-based learning tracking (not course-based)
- ✅ Open-source + commercial models
- ✅ Built by practicing roboticists, for roboticists

**Competitors can't quickly copy this.** But you need to move fast to own the niche.

## Key Numbers (Keep These in Mind)

- **TAM:** $500K-1.3M ARR (India) in 3 years
- **Conservative Year 1:** $11K (mostly free users)

## 🎯 The Problem

Roboticists learn across domains: computer vision, control systems, simulation, reinforcement learning, hardware integration, IoT...

But there's **no single platform** to:
- Track progress across all domains
- Adapt learning paths based on your background
- Generate realistic learning roadmaps
- Measure skill growth over time
- Guide you intelligently toward your goals

RoboMentor solves this.

## ✨ What RoboMentor Does

**1. Intelligent Onboarding** (15 min)
- Tell us about your background, goals, and available time
- AI generates a personalized learning roadmap
- 20+ robotics skills assessment

**2. Session Tracking** (Every learning hour)
- Log tutorials, experiments, projects, reading
- Categorize by domain (CV, control, sim, RL, hardware, IoT)
- Automatic progress calculation

**3. Adaptive Learning Paths**
- Speeds up if you're ahead
- Slows down if you're behind
- Re-generates if your goals change

**4. AI Mentor**
- Quiz you on concepts
- Suggest next steps
- Provide real-time feedback

**5. Skill Dashboard**
- Heatmap of skill progress
- Weekly/monthly analytics
- Visualization of journey

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avyay-intellitech/robomentor.git
cd robomentor

# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd electron-app
npm install
npm start
```

## 🎓 How It Works

```
You start → 6-step onboarding → AI generates roadmap → Start learning
    ↓
Log sessions → Track progress → AI adapts → Keep learning
    ↓
Repeat → Skill growth → Reach goals
```

## 📊 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), SQLite, LLM (OpenRouter GPT-4o)
- **Frontend:** Electron.js, HTML/CSS/JS
- **Speech:** Whisper (STT), pyttsx3 (TTS)
- **Embeddings:** sentence-transformers (semantic search)

## 💡 Who's This For?

✅ **Robotics Engineers** learning new domains
✅ **Students** building skill systematically
✅ **Startups** onboarding new team members
✅ **Teams** tracking collective skill evolution
✅ **Educators** structuring robotics curricula

## Outreach Email Templates

### To Robotics Companies

```
Subject: RoboMentor—Learning OS for Your Team

Hi [Name],

I'm Tejas from Avyay Intellitech. We just open-sourced RoboMentor, an AI-powered learning platform built specifically for roboticists.

When we onboard new engineers at Avyay, we face a challenge:
- How do we get them up to speed on CV, control, simulation, hardware?
- How do we know they're ready for projects?
- How do we close skill gaps efficiently?

RoboMentor solves this.

We're looking for 10 robotics companies to beta-test our Team Edition for free for 3 months. If interested, let's chat.

GitHub: https://github.com/avyay-intellitech/robomentor

Thanks,
Tejas
```

### To Universities

```
Subject: Free RoboMentor for Your Robotics Program

Hi [Professor/Dean],

We just released RoboMentor, an open-source learning OS for roboticists.

For universities, we're offering free institutional licenses to use RoboMentor in your robotics curriculum.

Benefits:
- Structured learning paths for students
- Track skill evolution across domains (CV, control, sim, RL, hardware)
- Better learning outcomes (measurable)
- No infrastructure cost (open-source, local-first)

Interested? Let's explore this together.
